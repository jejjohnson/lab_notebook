# Gaussian Dists. and GPs

In this summary, I will be exploring what makes Gaussian distributions so special as well as the relation they have with IT measures. I'll also look at some extensions to Gaussian Processes (GPs) and what connection they have have with IT measures.

### GPs, Entropy, Residuals


Easy to compute stuff out of a GP (which is a joint multivariate Gaussian with covariance K) would be:
1) Differential) entropy from the GP:

$$\begin{aligned}
H(X) &= 0.5 \cdot log( (2 \cdot \pi \cdot e)^n \cdot \text{det}(K_x) ) \\
H(X) &= \frac{N}{2} \cdot \log(2 \cdot \pi \cdot e) +  \log |K_x| 
\end{aligned}
$$

$$H(X_y|X_A)=\frac{1}{2} \log \left(\nu_{X_y|X_A}^2 \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( \log(2\pi) + 1 \right)$$

where:

* Conditional Variance: $\nu^2_{y|A}=K_{yy}- \Sigma_{y|A}\Sigma_{AA}^{-1}\Sigma_{Ay}$
