## Story Principle

There is typically a 3-step rule for telling a story especially when you want people to learn something from it. We're stupid, we need repitition. The repeat rule of 3 is what I'll use to structure the thesis.

1. Tell them what you're going to tell them
   > * Key Ideas
2. Tell them
   > * Data Representation
   > * Information
3. Tell them what you told them
   > * Discussion
   > * Conclusion

## Writing Principles (SEED)

I will try to follow this principle for writing. brief and succinct. I want my statements to really explore and develop one single idea before moving on to the next idea. So in order to keep things in control, I will follow the SEED principle. 

1. Statement
2. Explanation
3. Evidence
4. Development

## Philosophy

**Explanations**
> If you can't explain it simply, then you don't understand it enough - Einstein

**Code Snippets**
> Talk is cheap. Show me the code - Linus Torvald

**Lab Notebooks**
> OK. But how does it work in practice?
> AutoDiff all the things!

**Sleeper Theorems**
> I'll leave it up to the user as an exercise | It's easy to show that | as seen in [1]

## Parting Words

I like to leave parting words. I see this in a blog by Matthew Rocklin all of the time

1. What I did I do
2. What I did I not do
3. What I could have done better
4. What will I do in the future?

Another way to look at it is to have **strengths** and **limitations** in my discussions and conclusions. In my highschool, I typically had to do 5 of each; sometimes 10 of each if we behaved badly in class. It was tough but it made us think critically and reflect upon our work.

## Details

Often times, we have many details that I think is important to know but not necessarily important to tell the story. Theorems, derivations, side notes, are very important but sometimes I think we can omit them from the main body of the text. I will create a few tabs that will hide some of these details I deem irrelevant for the story.

<details>
<summary>
    <font color="black">Details
    </font>
</summary>

These are simply details that I feel are side notes.

Code examples that maybe tell you how to algorithmically do something. They might also feature snippets of some practical modifcations that may occur in the field.

<details>
<summary>
    <font color="red">Proof
    </font>
</summary>

I am not a fan of proofs being in the main body of the text (unless the text is about proofs). In ML, often this is not necessary except for a theoretical paper. In applied settings, we only need main equations and the rest of the details can go in the appendix.

## Reproducibility

1. **Repeatability**: Same team, same experimental setup
2. **Replicability**: different team, same experimental setup
3. **Reproducibility**: different team, different experimental set up
