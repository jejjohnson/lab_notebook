## Motivation

So I have been looking into ways that we can use information theory measures (ITMs) to do summary statistics for large data structures. The data structures can be thought of as cubes where we care about the latitude, longitude and the time for different variables. Concretely, we are looking at a 4D dataset in the form of
$$
\mathbf{X} = X(\phi,\lambda, t, z)
$$
where $\phi$ is the latitude, $\lambda$ is the longitude, $t$ is the time, $z$ is the variable. So we have a dataset where we have spatial, temporal and variable considerations.
