## Philosophy

Overall, I don't want to waste anything. I find it a shame that we have so many resources separated. For example, the documentation for code (especially dense packages) often have no math associated with this. Another example is the thesis of a graduate student often has no code snippets or lab examples of some of the stuff that they have implemented. Why aren't these fused together? I'm not saying that we need to have super long documents with code snippets, but it costs you nothing to add your relevant thesis snippets to your code documentation. So, I will try to be doing all things at once:

* Thesis
* Blog Posts
* Software
* Journal Articles
