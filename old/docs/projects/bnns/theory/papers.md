# Papers

This page highlights some of the key papers that we will go over during the working group. I have organized the sections into topics and each section will have the appropriate literature. I will keep the papers that we will go in detail near the top and any supporting papers will go at the bottom. 

!> **Warning**: This is not the final list. This is merely a guide that we will pivot off of.

### Bayesian

* The prior can generally only be understood in the context of the likelihood - Gelman et. al. (2017) - [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07487) | [blog](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/04/03/justify-my-love/)



### Introduction to Bayesian Deep Learning

* Practical Deep Learning with Bayesian Principles - Warner & Neal (1997) -[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02506)
* Towards Bayesian Deep Learning: A Survey - Wang et. al. (2016)

### Approximately Bayesian
